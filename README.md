## Features

This application includes a robust set of features designed to mimic a modern chat experience:

### üè† **Homepage & Room Management**
* **Persistent Room List:** The homepage displays a list of all rooms you have joined, which is saved in the browser's local storage.
* **Real-time Unread Counts:** A badge next to each room name on the homepage shows the number of unread messages and updates instantly when new messages arrive.
* **Room Search:** A search bar to filter and find rooms on the homepage.
* **Simple Room Removal:** Ability to remove a room from your homepage list.

### üö™ **Room Creation & Joining**
* **Automatic Naming:** Rooms and users are assigned unique, random names (`R#...` and `USER-...`) to allow for quick anonymous use.
* **Password Protection:** Users can create rooms with an optional password.
* **Seamless Re-entry:** Users who have previously joined a password-protected room do not need to re-enter the password to join again.

### üí¨ **Chat & Messaging**
* **Real-time Messaging:** Live messaging powered by WebSockets.
* **Message History:** The server stores message history for each room, which are loaded instantly upon joining.
* **Message Search:** A search bar within a chat session to find specific messages.
* **Read Receipts ("Message Info"):**
    * Clicking on any message opens a modal with its delivery information.
    * For messages you've sent, you can see a list of who has seen the message and the exact time they first saw it.
    * This "seen" status is persistent and remains even if users go offline.
* **Auto-Sizing Textbox:** The message input area grows and shrinks automatically as you type.

### üë§ **User Experience & UI**
* **Collapsible Sidebar:** The side panel shows all members of the room.
* **Live Online Status:** A green dot appears next to the names of members who are currently active in the chat session.
* **Typing Indicator:** See when other users are typing in real-time.
* **Creator-Specific Actions:** A room's creator has the exclusive ability to either permanently close a room for all users or to simply leave the room themselves.
